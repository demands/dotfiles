# Demands' dotfile repository

Managed using [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm). I try and comment as much as possible. Glad to accept issues / pull requests.

## Installing

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Projects/dotilfes && git clone https://github.com/demands/dotfiles && ~/.Projects/dotfiles/install.sh
```

## Just browsing?

Make sure you [take a look at my .vimrc](https://raw.github.com/demands/dotfiles/master/vimrc). I'm particularly fond of it.
